# hello-world
This is a simple first repository
This is Patricia learning the ins and outs of GitHub once again!  I dibble and dabble before, but since I am aspiring to be a Data Scientist; I figured that I should become pretty familiar with GitHub because I may be using it regularly.  I am merely making changes to this Readme.md file and will then click on the Commit Changes to save them. Thanks for viewing if you are!
